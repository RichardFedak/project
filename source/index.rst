IoT Project Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the **IoT Project** documentation! This documentation will guide you through the various components, design decisions, and implementation details of the IoT system.

Introduction
------------

The **IoT Project** is a cutting-edge system designed to connect physical devices to the internet, enabling them to send and receive data in real-time. The project leverages modern technologies to provide scalable, reliable, and secure communication between devices and the cloud.

Key Features
------------

- **Real-time Monitoring**: The system allows for continuous monitoring of connected devices.
- **Data Analytics**: Provides real-time data analytics for quick decision-making.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle thousands of devices with ease.
- **Security**: Implements robust encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure data privacy.

Overview
--------
The IoT project enables a variety of devices to connect seamlessly to a central hub, where data is collected, processed, and transmitted to a cloud platform. This enables monitoring and controlling of devices from anywhere in the world.

Architecture
------------
The system follows a **client-server** model. Devices (clients) communicate with a central server, which processes the data and stores it in a secure database. The server exposes a RESTful API for data access and device management.

Setup
-----
To set up the IoT system, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Required Software**:
   Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal:

   .. code-block:: bash
      python --version

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   .. code-block:: bash
      git clone https://github.com/username/iot-project.git

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies using pip:

   .. code-block:: bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----
Once the system is set up, you can begin using it right away. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Connect a Device**: 
   Connect a supported IoT device to the network and ensure it’s powered on.
   
2. **Access the Dashboard**: 
   Open the web-based dashboard at `http://localhost:5000` to view real-time data from your devices.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting guide for common problems and solutions.

### Common Issues:

- **Device not connecting to the network**: Ensure the device is within range of the Wi-Fi network and the network credentials are correct.
- **Data not updating on the dashboard**: Check if the server is running and verify the device is properly sending data.
